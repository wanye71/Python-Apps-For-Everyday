### Desktop Maid
I created Desktop Maid because I am always creating Python projects from my desktop. Afterawhile, though, as you know this can be come crowded and messy, making coding life harder than we want. Here is a [link (Desktop Maid)](https://github.com/wanye71/Python-Apps-For-Everyday/blob/desktop_maid/desktop_maid.py)  to the source code. There you will find detailed code comments that will help you understand what every parts and pieces purpose is.
