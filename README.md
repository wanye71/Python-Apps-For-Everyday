# This is a Python App repo

This repo is a collection of Python applications that solve real world problems. As the repo grows I'll amend the TOC that leads you to the script. Thanks for stopping by.

## Table of Contents
1. [Desktop Maid](#desktop-maid)
2. [Recipe Curator](#recipe-curator)


### Desktop Maid
I created Desktop Maid because I am always creating Python projects from my desktop. Afterawhile, though, as you know this can be come crowded and messy, making coding life harder than we want. Here is a [link (Desktop Maid)](https://github.com/wanye71/Python-Apps-For-Everyday/blob/desktop_maid/desktop_maid.py)  to the source code. There you will find detailed code comments that will help you understand what every parts and pieces purpose is.

### Recipe Curator
This app simply scrapes the allrecipes.com site for recipes and then parses the result and sent to an SQLite database. As I add more features, I'll be adding additional information. But for now, go ahead and fork away if you like. And have fun. [Recipe Curator](https://github.com/wanye71/Python-Apps-For-Everyday/tree/recipe_scraper)
