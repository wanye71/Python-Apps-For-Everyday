Place potatoes in a large microwave-safe bowl with a few tablespoons water, and cook on High, stopping occasionally to stir potatoes, until nearly tender, 5 to 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat butter and olive oil in a large stock pot over medium heat. Add onion, celery, bell pepper, and garlic, and cook and stir until onion begins to turn translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in andouille, and cook for about 5 minutes more.
Pour in vegetable broth; bring to a simmer, add potatoes, and cook until potatoes are fork-tender, about 15 minutes.
Stir in cream; season to taste with Cajun seasoning, and cook just until heated through. Serve hot in bowls; sprinkle each bowl with Parmesan cheese.
